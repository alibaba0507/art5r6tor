&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although some Forex brokers will let you start trading with as little as $1, you will need to deposit at least $12 with a broker offering nano lots or $120 with a broker offering micro lots in order to day trade safely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The amount of money you need to start will depend upon your broker’s:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and your:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;How much money can you make trading Forex&quot; class=&quot;LazyLoading img-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/images/placeholder.svg&quot; data-src=&quot;/files/woman-3261425_1920.jpg&quot; title=&quot;How much money can you make trading Forex&quot;/&gt;In order to trade Forex effectively, you need a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-brokers-reviews/page-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forex broker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Trying to trade Forex using a regular bank account or a money changer is too costly and slow to be a realistic option. So, the starting point to answering this question is, what is the minimum deposit required by a Forex broker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex brokers won’t let you trade with real money until you have deposited their required minimum deposit, which these days is usually about $100. However, &lt;strong&gt;there are Forex brokers that require no minimum deposit at all, so theoretically you could start trading Forex with as little as $1. Unfortunately, if you try to trade Forex with such a small amount of money, you will quickly run into several problems&lt;/strong&gt;, starting with minimum position sizes and maximum leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Broker Minimum Position Size and Maximum Leverage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of Forex brokers will not let you make a trade sized smaller than 1 micro lot (0.01 lots) which is worth 1,000 units of the base currency.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, 1 micro lot of the USD/JPY currency pair is worth $1,000. This means that you will need &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2009/02/the-foundations-of-forex-how-leverage-margin-and-pip-values-are-calculated/440&quot;&gt;leverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in order to make any trade in the USD/JPY currency pair with a deposit of less than $1,000. If a broker offers a maximum leverage of 30 to 1 on this currency pair (typical in the European Union), you will need to deposit at least $33.34 just to make one trade in USD/JPY. If maximum leverage of 50 to 1 is offered (typical in the United States), you will need to deposit at least $20 to make a trade in USD/JPY. If maximum leverage of 500 to 1 is offered (typical in Australia), you will need to deposit at least $2 to make a trade in USD/JPY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just because lots of leverage is offered to you as a trader, does not mean that it is wise to use it. The minimum amount of money you need to make just one trade in Forex is determined by:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The maximum leverage offered by your Forex broker in what you want to trade (leverage varies from asset to asset and country to country); and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The minimum position size you can trade with your broker in what you want to trade (this is usually 1 micro lot).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a few Forex brokers allowing trading in a minimum position size even lower than 1 micro lot. This lower size is 1 nano lot&lt;/strong&gt;, which is equal to 0.001 lots. Continuing with our example of placing a trade in the USD/JPY currency pair, 1 nano lot would be equal to a position size in cash of $100, so with leverage of 100 to 1, a deposit of $1 would be enough margin to open that trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Brokers Offering Nano Lot Trading&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/fxtm/fxtm-review/2193&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FXTM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is a regulated Forex broker offering trading in nano lots. Their highest maximum leverage offered is 1000 to 1 and their minimum deposit required is $10. There are several other brokers also offering trading in nano lots.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/oanda/oanda-review/4&quot;&gt;Oanda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, for example, takes it even further and allows you to place a trade with a position size as low as $1 or 1 unit of any other base currency, meaning you can trade with $1 without using any leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we have considered only broker-imposed limitations affecting how much money you need to start trading Forex. We still need to consider the issues of risk management, stop losses, meaningfulness of profits, and different types of trading styles, all of which are important factors in answering this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Risk Management Affects Deposit Size&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked earlier at the minimum amount of money you need to enter just one trade. Yet &lt;strong&gt;Forex trading involves taking a large number of trades.&lt;/strong&gt; Even a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2010/07/forex-trading-styles-position-trader/5540&quot;&gt;position trader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; who might aim to stay in winning trades for a few weeks or even a few months would probably expect to take at least ten trades over a year, and shorter-term traders such as swing traders or scalpers many more trades than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2016/07/dealing-with-losses/61113&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forex trading involves losing trades&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. There is simply no way around that: any trader, even the very best Forex trader, will lose at least one third of all the trades he makes.&lt;/strong&gt; It is well known that winning and losing trades are not evenly distributed: markets tend to go through winning and losing streaks. This means that &lt;strong&gt;every trader should plan for a worst-case losing streak of at least twenty losing trades in a row.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Every trader should also plan for their worst drawdown&lt;/strong&gt; (peak to trough account decrease). Once your account Is down by more than 20%, it gets harder and harder to get back to the peak, because the gain required to achieve it rises exponentially. For example, if your account is down by 50%, you need to make 100% from what remains to get back to where you were before the 50% loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume you don’t ever want your trading account to be down by more than 20% and your worst losing streak will probably be 20 losing trades in a row. This means that you should risk no more than 1% of your account per trade. But wait – you may only ever lose 20 trades in a row, but it is likely that your net losing trades within any major drawdown will be approximately double that, with a few winners mixed in. This implies that &lt;strong&gt;you probably should risk no more than 0.5% of your account on a single trade.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, if you are going to need due to minimum position sizing, leverage, and trade stop loss requirements, say $1 for a single trade, you will have to multiply that by 200 to come up with the minimum amount you need to trade Forex. You are also going to need to think about how big your typical trade stop loss is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as losing streaks, traders have to worry about a wild, sudden price movement causing massive &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2019/04/what-is-slippage-in-forex-trading/112235&quot;&gt;slippage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; beyond a trade’s stop loss. This usually only happens with pegged or manipulated currencies, such as the Swiss Franc in 2015. This is another reason why it is usually a good idea to risk only a small percentage of your account on any single trade. It should also help to trade liquid major currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Stop Losses Affect Deposit Size&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should never enter a trade without inputting a hard stop loss.&lt;/strong&gt; The hard stop loss tells your broker that when the trade has gone against you by a certain amount, to close the trade immediately. Although the stop loss will not always be executed at the exact price given when markets are volatile, &lt;strong&gt;it is a useful and very important way to limit your risk and control your losses. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop losses should always be determined by technical analysis, not by how big a stop loss you can “afford”&lt;/strong&gt; due to the amount of money in your trading account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say you want to risk 0.5% of your account on a trade, and you want your typical stop loss to be 100 pips. The smallest trade position size your broker allows is 1 micro lot, which on a USD based currency costs $0.10 per pip. This means that your 100 pip stop loss will require that you risk 100 X $0.10 which equals $10. You want this $10 to be no more than 0.5% of your account – and that means you are going to have to make a deposit of $2,000 to start Forex trading with enough money to make 100 pip stop losses work, if your broker only goes as low by size as micro lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t ever make a stop loss smaller than you really want it to be just because you can’t “afford” it with your account size. Either put more money in your account, find a Forex broker that allows trading in nano lots, or consider switching to a style of trading which typically requires tighter stop losses.&lt;/strong&gt; The three styles of Forex trading are position trading, swing trading, and scalping, and we’ll consider them each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much Money Do I Need to Position Trade Forex?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position traders look for trades which take several days or even weeks or months to complete, and so &lt;strong&gt;usually need to use stop losses of about 100 to 150 pips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming you don’t want to risk more than 0.5% of your account on any trade, and that you will never lose more than 20% of your account, you should &lt;strong&gt;start with a deposit of at least $2,500 to $3,750 at a Forex broker offering trading in micro lots, or at least $250 to $375 at a Forex broker offering nano lots. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much Money Do I Need to Swing Trade Forex?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2011/06/swing-trading-advantages-and-disadvantages/8182&quot;&gt;Swing traders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; look for trades which take from between about one to eight days to complete, and so &lt;strong&gt;usually need to use stop losses of about 30 to 60 pips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming you don’t want to risk more than 0.5% of your account on any trade, and that you will never lose more than 20% of your account, you should &lt;strong&gt;start with a deposit of at least $720 to $1,440 at a Forex broker offering trading in micro lots, or at least $72 to $144 at a Forex broker offering nano lots. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much Money Do I Need to Scalp or Day Trade Forex?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalpers or &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2017/01/day-trading-vs-swing-trading/70919&quot;&gt;day traders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; look for trades which take only seconds, minutes, or perhaps a few hours at most to complete, and so &lt;strong&gt;usually need to use stop losses of about 5 to 10 pips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming you don’t want to risk more than 0.5% of your account on any trade, and that you will never lose more than 20% of your account, you should &lt;strong&gt;start with a deposit of at least $120 to $240 at a Forex broker offering trading in micro lots, or at least $12 to $24 at a Forex broker offering nano lots. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Can I Start Forex with $100?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculations discussed above show that it is absolutely possible to trade Forex safely starting with an initial deposit of $100, &lt;strong&gt;if you use a Forex broker offering nano lots or smaller, and you are day trading, scalping or swing trading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is It Worth Trading Forex with a Low Minimum Deposit?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final issue to consider is, even if you can trade Forex safely with a small amount of money such as $50 or $100, is it really worth it? &lt;strong&gt;It all depends how much these sums of money mean to you and how much time and effort you are going to put into trading Forex.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say you double your money in a year. This is a great result for any trader and will probably take a lot of work. Yet if you start with $100, you will only have $200 after this great result. Maybe it isn’t worth it if you can, for example, save that amount of money by making other changes in your life (such as saving more) without putting your capital at risk. &lt;strong&gt;It might be smarter to wait until you have a bigger amount to start with, because then such profit would be more meaningful to you and feel like it is worth the work you put into making it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody should ever trade Forex with money they cannot afford to lose&lt;/strong&gt;, but you probably won’t stay motivated for long if you trade with an amount of money which is so small and trivial to you that you don’t feel like you care much about the result. &lt;strong&gt;You need to find a balance which works for your trading style, your emotional style, and your financial situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The USD/CAD edged up 0.1% to 1.3143. Official data showed that Canada\'s retail sales grew 0.9% on month in November (+0.6% expected). Other commodity-linked currencies were broadly lower against the greenback. AUD/USD slid 0.3% to 0.6829 and NZD/USD slipped 0.1% to 0.6609. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding economic data, the Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) unexpectedly declined to 51.7 (preliminary reading) in January, missing 52.4 expected, while the Services PMI rose to 53.2, better than 53.0 anticipated. Later today, December U.S. new home sales will be reported (up to an annualized rate of 731,000 units expected).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/JPY - 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement Completes &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/JPY  closed at 109.278 after placing a high of 109.650 and a low of 109.170. The USD/JPY pair dropped for the 4th consecutive day on Friday on the back of increased demand for safe-haven Japanese Yen amid rising fears of coronavirus effects on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the data front, the National Core CPI for the year from Japan was released at 4:30 GMT, and it remained flat with the expectations of 0.7%. At 5:30 GMT, the Flash Manufacturing PMI from Japan exceeded the expectations in January and came in as 49.3 against the expected 48.9. Hence, I supported the Japanese Yen on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of the Japanese Yen after the release of Manufacturing PMI put pressure on USD/JPY and dragged its prices further on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan released its December Monetary policy meeting minutes on Friday. In those minutes, the members of the Bank of Japan showed a possible need for further easing if personal spending decreases after the consumption tax increase in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan narrated that there will be a need for further monetary easing if the underlying consumption trend continued in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Governor of Bank of Japan, Haruhiko &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/boj&quot;&gt;Kuroda&lt;/a&gt;, said on Friday that economy likely to suffer in the final quarter of 2019 because of 2 cyclones that struck the country and affected the factory output. He added that natural disasters have intensified in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also added that prolonged lower interest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates&quot;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; could impose adverse effects on the country\'s banking system. On the other hand, he also defended BoJ\'s ultra-easy policy, which helped to eradicate deflation from the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/JPY - Daily Trade Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/JPY is still trading in a selling mode at 108.850, dropping below 50% &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci&quot;&gt;Fibonacci&lt;/a&gt; retracement level, and it\'s heading towards 61.8%, which marks 108.620. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RSI and Stochastics are also heading into the selling zone, signaling chances that the USD/JPY may need to retrace back a bit before heading down further. On the 4 hour timeframe, the USD/JPY pair has opened a with a gap, and typically such gaps are filled with on the same day or a day after that. Let\'s see. But today, we should look for selling trades below 109.150 and buying positions above $108.650.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/CAD - Overbought Pair, Is It Going to Retrace?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/CAD closed at 1.31469 after placing a high of 1.31524 and a low of 1.31175. At 18:30 GMT, the Core Retail Sales for the month of November from Canada was released, which showed a decline of 0.2% against the expectation of 0.5% and weighed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad&quot;&gt;Canadian dollar&lt;/a&gt;. The Retail Sales, however, showed an expansion to 0.9% against 0.6% in the month of November and supported the Canadian dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Core Retail Sales was closely watched among traders to place their bets for Loonie, and when it was released weaker than expected, it weighed on the Canadian dollar and ultimately raised the prices of USD/CAD on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Crude oil was on bearish trend on the back of coronavirus fears on Friday and reached to its lowest since early November. Weak crude oil weighed on commodity-linked Loonie and supported the rise on USD/CAD prices at the ending day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the American front, the U.S. dollar was in strength against its rival currencies on Friday amid the sharp rise in U.S. Services PMI. At 19:45, the Flash Services PMI from the U.S. for the month of January exceeded the expectations of 52.9 and came in as 53.2. Expansion in the Services sector of the United States gave strength to the U.S. dollar and added in the upward movement of USD/CAD pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/CAD - Daily Trade Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/CAD is testing the double top level at 1.3196 as the stronger dollar drove the pair higher. On the 240 mins chart, the pair has formed a bullish engulfing candle followed by a series of green candles is also suggesting odds of more buying in the USD/CAD currency pair. Bullish crossover of 1.3196 can lead the USD/CAD prices higher towards 1.3270, while the support continues to stay around 1.3110. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;AUD/USD – Triangle Pattern Breakout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUD/USD pair closed at 0.68251 after placing a high of 0.68569 and a low of 0.68172. The AUD/USD sank to its lowest level since December 11 on Friday amid the sensitive outlook of China\'s economy due to coronavirus fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook of the Chinese economy suffered due to widespread of latest coronavirus in China. The origin of the virus was blamed at Wuhan city of China, which has been blocked by Chinese officials to embrace the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese Equity Market has fallen and suffered a lot because of this virus, and it has also raised the fears that the global economy could get affected because of viruses too. This has resulted in weakened Chinese Yuan, and as a result, China-proxy Australian dollar got weakened also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weak Australian dollar dragged the prices of the AUD/USD pair on Friday. The downfall in pair\'s prices was added after the release of Manufacturing PMI from Australia. At 3:00 GMT, the Flash &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar&quot;&gt;Manufacturing PMI&lt;/a&gt; came in as 49.1 in the month of January, which was less than the December\'s 49.2. The contraction in the Manufacturing Sector of Australia added to the weakness of Aussie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flash Services PMI from Australia for the month of January also declined to 48.9 from December\'s 49.8 and weighed on the Australian dollar. Both the Manufacturing &amp;amp; Services Sector of Australia showed a contraction in the month of January and dragged the pair AUD/USD further on Friday near its multi week\'s lowest level of 0.68100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the U.S. dollar was strong in the financial market against its rival currencies on the back of strong Services PMI. At 19:45 GMT, the Flash Services PMI form the United States showed an expansion in the services sector of the United States for the month of January when released as 53.2 against 52.9. Strong U.S. dollar added in the downfall of Aussie, and hence AUD/USD was dropped further at the ending day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;AUD/USD - Daily Trade Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUD/USD has violated the long-held triangle pattern, which supported the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd&quot;&gt;Aussie&lt;/a&gt; around 0.6825. The AUD/USD is now trading at 0.6760, having formed a bearish marabou candle on the 4-hour chart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pair may find immediate support around 0.6760, and below this level, we may see further sell-off until 0.6715. Since the RSI is heavily oversold, we may also experience a bullish correction in the AUD/USD pair. Let\'s consider taking a sell trade below 0.6800 and buying above 0.67500. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is new licensing regime for forex lipstick on a frog? - Business Day</title>
<link>https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2020-01-22-is-new-licensing-regime-for-forex-lipstick-on-a-frog/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2020-01-22-is-new-licensing-regime-for-forex-lipstick-on-a-frog/</guid>
<description>   &lt;p&gt;So far, the new regime is being met with cautious optimism by the local industry. Jimmy Moyaha, an independent consultant in the financial markets space, is clear that change is much needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;With this new regime it’s a real chance to clean up our industry — the local industry has gone through a difficult time recently, we have seen a lot of forex scams and it is very difficult for legitimate providers to conduct business in an environment where consumers are regularly getting scammed,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having interviewed several local forex brokers, this is a recurring theme — that scams and bad brokers are damaging the industry. The more people read about forex scams, and the more people fall victim to unscrupulous brokers, the more the reputation of the industry suffers. And this is something legitimate brokers want to be put right as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Moyaha points out: “&lt;span&gt;We have a real opportunity here with the ODP licence to sweep out all of the junk that’s in the local industry and create a cleaner market. That’s why the ODP licence has been created, I believe — to clean out the bad apples and start again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other brokers we talked to were less sure that the ODP licence is a good thing for the industry, not because new regulation isn’t needed, but because the new regulation is not built for the SA market and will be unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One FSCA-regulated, award-winning brokerage would only speak to us on condition of anonymity. One of their concerns was that the FSCA had not engaged fully with the local industry before deciding on the new regulatory regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;Frankly, in our industry, the cost of compliance is very low — there is an incentive for business to try to circumvent whatever legislation has been put in place. So, anything apart from full engagement [with the forex broking industry] will end in a situation where the FSCA and the market players will be diametrically opposed, which will not end well for anyone,” the broker said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What are the advantages of this new regime? Because I don’t see much. I wish [the FSCA] had gone further, in terms of the suitability requirements for traders and the integration of trading records between market players.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As it stands, the ODP licensing regime is still in the application phase, so it remains to be seen exactly what final form it will take. The FSCA is certainly planning a more transparent and better-regulated market, but the concern is that the new regime will be a redecoration rather than a complete overhaul, the broker said.&lt;/p&gt;   </description>

<title>Forex Today: Risk aversion fuels dollar’s advance - FXStreet</title>

                    &lt;p&gt;Here is what you need to know on Tuesday, January 28th:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;On Sunday, the Chinese Health Commission reported that the coronavirus transmission ability is getting stronger and that infections could continue to rise. Financial markets reflected the concerns related to the virus outbreak, with safe-haven assets gapping higher. The dollar appreciated against most major rivals but those considered a refugee in turmoil times.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;EUR/USD neared 1.1000 as the German IFO Survey missed the market’s expectations in January, combining with the broad dollar’s strength.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GBP/USD peaked at 1.3105 but eased ahead of critical events in the UK later this week. The BOE will meet on Thursday, and there are chances that Governor Carney may cut rates before leaving his seat. Brexit is scheduled for this Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Japanese yen was the strongest, the AUD the weakest in a risk-averse environment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gold gapped higher and held on to gains, finishing the day around $1,580 a troy ounce.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Crude oil prices were also under pressure, ending the day at 3-month lows amid dollar’s strength, fears of an oversupplied market.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/crypto-today-bitcoin-bulls-break-back-above-critical-8500-barrier-202001271950&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Crypto Today: Bitcoin bulls break back above critical $8500 barrier&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

For example, if you are trading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/gbp-usd&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;GBP/USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; you need to be fully in tune with all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/03/27/bank-of-england.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Bank of England&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/08/16/federal-reserve-bank.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;US Federal Reserve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; policy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;moves and speeches – both drive the market.

It is often thought of as a ‘growth’ or ‘risk’ correlated unit – one which is likely to gain when the world feels better about global growth and struggle when the reverse is the case. While this is often true, there are a huge number of other possible drivers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/major-commodities&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Major commodity prices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Australian monetary policy prospects and localized political risk can all see it move against the general market grain at times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;In these days of highly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2018/12/26/currency-correlation.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;correlated markets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; it’s tempting to separate currencies into ‘risk on’ and ‘risk off’ camps but this is far too simplistic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;3) Remember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;t takes two &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;to forex tango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Currency pairs are driven by both sides of the equation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;” – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/authors/Martin_Essex&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Martin Essex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;dfx-lazyload gsstx&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; data-image-original-width=&quot;165&quot; data-image-original-height=&quot;165&quot; alt=&quot;Martin Essex, DailyFX analyst&quot; data-src=&quot;https://a.c-dn.net/b/25Csmq/how-to-become-a-forex-trader_body_Martin_Essex.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;When trading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;currencies,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; a trader needs to understand what is happening in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;both relevant territories.

Here’s the checklist:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;1) Find the right broker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Choosing the best forex broker will make all the difference when it comes to benefiting from quality of user experience, reliable client support and competitive pricing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;2) Know how trading capital works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;As a forex trader you must understand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/02/12/using-margin-in-forex-trading.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/02/08/what-is-leverage-in-forex-trading.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;leverage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;. Margin allows a trader to open leveraged positions, meaning greater exposure to the market with smaller capital outlay. Newer traders often look at unused margin as buying power and therefore tend to be too aggressive on their position sizing. Leverage maximizes gains and losses making your account equity quite volatile. Regardless of the amount of leverage your broker offers, we suggest using little or no leverage in your trading.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;3) Start with a demo account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Practice with a demo account to familiarize yourself with the markets. From here, you can build and refine a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/06/12/top-forex-trading-strategies.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;trading strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;, get comfortable with your chosen platform and build the confidence you need to trade real money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;4) Take the plunge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Trade small with your real money account at first, and work your way up. Trade with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/10/07/risk-management-techniques.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;risk management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; protocols in place, using stop losses, and only trade when you have undertaken in-depth analysis, whether trading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/03/12/how-to-combine-fundamental-technical-analysis.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;fundamentals or technicals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;, or both. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;5) Never stop building your knowledge – and character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Winning traders never stop learning and building their expertise on key markets.

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
							       &lt;p&gt;* Investors seek safety as cases of coronavirus rise &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#13;
  * Yuan hits three-week low, Aussie lowest since early&amp;#13;
  December&amp;#13;
  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#13;
  * Yen bounces but erases most of its early gains&amp;#13;
  &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China\'s yuan tumbled to a 2020&amp;#13;
  low on Monday and commodity-linked currencies such as the&amp;#13;
  Australian dollar fell, as growing fears about the spread of a&amp;#13;
  coronavirus from China pushed investors into safer assets.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The yen was the main beneficiary, although its move higher&amp;#13;
  was limited. The Japanese currency touched its highest since&amp;#13;
  Jan. 8.&amp;#13;
  Health authorities around the world are working to prevent a&amp;#13;
  pandemic of the virus, which has killed more than 80 people in&amp;#13;
China. &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2,800 people have been infected globally. China\'s&amp;#13;
  National Health Commission said on Sunday the ability of the&amp;#13;
  virus to spread was getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;China\'s government announced it would extend the Lunar New&amp;#13;
  Year holidays to help prevent and control the virus. Hong Kong has also banned the entry of people who have&amp;#13;
visited the province of Hubei in the past 14 days. &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak&amp;#13;
  was first reported in Hubei. RBC Capital Markets\' FX strategist Elsa Lignos said that&amp;#13;
  while some would argue that fears about the virus were overdone,&amp;#13;
  given the low mortality rate, &quot;the bigger worry is the economic&amp;#13;
  impact of containment and quarantine strategies, particularly in&amp;#13;
  China.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The offshore yuan shed more than 0.8% to 6.99 yuan per&amp;#13;
  dollar , its weakest since Dec. 30.&amp;#13;
  After rallying to a five-and-a-half month high earlier in&amp;#13;
  January, the yuan has gone into a tailspin. The dollar has&amp;#13;
  gained more than 2% versus the Chinese currency since last&amp;#13;
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt; The Australian dollar, which is exposed to the Chinese&amp;#13;
  economy, dropped 0.8% to $0.6771 , its lowest since Dec.&amp;#13;
  2. The New Zealand dollar weakened 0.7%.&amp;#13;
  Traders said market moves could be exaggerated by low&amp;#13;
  liquidity. Financial markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and&amp;#13;
  Australia are closed for holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The yen rose as high as 108.73 yen but was last down 0.3% at&amp;#13;
  108.91 yen per dollar .&amp;#13;
  &quot;Risk aversion is contagious, and coronavirus has infected&amp;#13;
  confidence across the board at the start of the week,&quot; said Kit&amp;#13;
  Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale.  &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell to a two-month low against the yen of 119.94&amp;#13;
  yen . 0.4% lower. It also lost ground to the Swiss&amp;#13;
  franc, slipping to a 33-month low of 1.0689 francs per euro .&amp;#13;
  The euro erased its earlier gains against the dollar after&amp;#13;
  the Ifo institute said that German business morale deteriorated&amp;#13;
  unexpectedly in January. The euro was unchanged at $1.1026 . &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar index was flat at 97.849 .&amp;#13;
  Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.3090 . Positioning data&amp;#13;
  last week showed investors reducing their net long position in&amp;#13;
  the pound before a Bank of England decision on Thursday about&amp;#13;
  whether to cut UK interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;  &amp;#13;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forex trading in Nigeria has become easier to get involved in during the past decade, which have also mostly seen strong economic growth and rising disposable incomes for many Nigerians despite post-2014 economic problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nigerian Forex traders can learn here how to get started trading Forex, the correct approach to learning how to trade and deciding upon a profitable trading strategy for use, and which &lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-brokers-reviews/page-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forex brokers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; are most suitable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nigeria’s Financial Situation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is home to over 186 million inhabitants, making it the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous in the world. The population is anticipated to exceed 250 million by 2050, while the country is already home to the third-largest youth population as well as the twentieth largest economy in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good measure of Nigeria’s increasing prosperity is the fact the gross domestic product per capita (per person) increased from $352 in 2001 to $3,222 in 2014 – an increase of approximately 900%! However, the figure has fallen sharply since 2014 to a little less than $2,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Nigeria’s position as a relatively prosperous African country, most Nigerians would agree that getting by is neither easy nor simple. When you combine these challenges with the fact that it is not impossible to get some spare cash together, you can see why Forex trading continues to become more and more popular in Nigeria. Despite this plus the fact that Forex traders in Nigeria are believed to trade positions worth as much as $1.25 million daily on average, very few international Forex / CFD brokerages maintain a presence in Nigeria, so Nigerian Forex traders are in need of more impartial guidance, which can be found in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Forex Trading in Nigeria&quot; class=&quot;LazyLoading img-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/images/placeholder.svg&quot; data-src=&quot;/files/nigeria-en-2020.png&quot; title=&quot;Forex Trading in Nigeria&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to Start Forex Trading in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential requirements to get started are the same as in any other country. Traders need to have a computer or mobile device, a stable internet connection, trading capital (more on how much you will need later), and an account with a trusted Forex broker.&lt;strong&gt; Reliability of internet connections and electricity supplies have become considerably more reliable in recent years, especially in urban areas, which makes Forex trading easier&lt;/strong&gt;. However, these factors mean traders in Nigeria should be careful to never execute a trade without inputting a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2019/02/do-you-really-need-a-stop-loss/110154&quot;&gt;hard stop loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, to prevent catastrophic losses in the event of a lost connection which cannot be re-established quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later sections in this article will discuss the practicalities of getting set up as a Forex trader. At this point, I emphasize that there is no point in trading Forex until you have a profitable trading strategy which you are psychologically ready to execute. You will not succeed in Forex with positive &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/forex-trading-psychology/page-1&quot;&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; alone, but a lack of psychological preparation can ruin the ability to successfully execute even a winning, profitable trading strategy.&lt;strong&gt; The lack of a sound trading strategy reduces Forex trading to gambling, with the odds stacked against the trader, and the eventual loss of the entire trading account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most proven trading strategy which has been proven to succeed over the years is a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2017/02/trend-trading-entries-pullbacks-or-breakouts/72528&quot;&gt;strategy which trades only in the direction of a strong trend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, cuts losing trades short, and lets winners run. However, even with such a good strategy, there will be losing trades and losing periods, which the trader must be psychologically ready to accept as inevitable. By keeping &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2017/09/how-much-should-i-risk-trading-forex/84161&quot;&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; small, a Forex trader can ensure survival through the losing periods and coming up ready to profit when the market turns profitable again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is important not to assume that Forex trading is easy money. It requires mental work and dedication.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is Forex Trading Legal in Nigeria?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Forex trading is legal in Nigeria if you trade your money for your personal benefit alone. This mirrors retail trading regulations in most countries. Raising capital from third parties for their benefit without a proper license to do so is illegal and, tempting as it may be, can get you into trouble if the third parties become dissatisfied and complain. Forex trading where you are managing other people’ money is extremely challenging psychologically. &lt;strong&gt;For these reasons, please trade only with your own money where losses are not catastrophic to your ability to pay your essential costs of living.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much do I Need to Start Trading Forex in Nigeria?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some Forex and CFD brokerages which require no minimum deposit and accept Nigerian residents as customers, so in theory at least, you can trade Forex in Nigeria with as little as $1. The problem is that due to issues of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2009/02/the-foundations-of-forex-how-leverage-margin-and-pip-values-are-calculated/440&quot;&gt;leverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and currency exchange with most Forex brokers not accepting deposits directly in Nigerian Naira, it is impractical to trade Forex with much less than $100 or its equivalent. Even $100 can be problematic due to trade size and leverage issues, so it is certainly true that something close to $500 will work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Forex broker with expertise in serving Nigerian resident clients is &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/fxtm/fxtm-review/2193&quot;&gt;FXTM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which, unusually for a major international Forex brokerage, has a physical presence in Nigeria. FXTM requires a minimum deposit from Nigerian residents of only ₦2,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Brokers in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian Forex market went through a boom-and-bust cycle between 2004 and 2010, and a wave of Ponzi schemes swept the country during this period. This atmosphere prevented interest in Forex trading in Nigeria from taking off, but the picture has improved considerably since 2010 as a calmer financial environment and generally increasing prosperity began to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FXTM is the sole international Forex / &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2011/06/what-are-cfds/8132&quot;&gt;CFD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; broker with a physical location in the country&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding to its appeal is the Naira trading account, which makes it very simple for traders to manage their portfolios as no currency conversion are required in order to execute deposits and withdrawals to and from an FXTM trading account. &lt;strong&gt;The acceptance of bank wires from Nigerian banks is a further improvement to the services offered by FXTM to Nigerian resident traders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few local Nigerian Forex brokers currently operating, if I were a Nigerian resident Forex trader, I would strongly prefer to open an account with an international brokerage instead of a local solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other international Forex / CFD brokerages which service Nigerian residents include &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/avatrade/avatrade-review/804&quot;&gt;AvaTrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/pepperstone/pepperstone-review/656&quot;&gt;Pepperstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/ic-markets/ic-markets-review/2144&quot;&gt;IC Markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Unfortunately, none of these brokers offer Naira accounts. &lt;strong&gt;Nigerian Forex traders will have to ensure that the brokers provide a payment processor catering to Nigeria, as currency conversions may pose a challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, the Forex market in Nigeria continues to strengthen and become a more attractive venue for international business, with the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbn.gov.ng/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Central Bank of Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (CBA) and the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sec.gov.ng/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (SEC) developing a stronger regulatory framework in recent years. &lt;strong&gt;More international Forex brokers are anticipated to follow FXTM into Nigeria, widening the choice for Nigerian Forex traders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Best Forex Trading Platforms in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best Forex trading platforms for Nigerian resident traders are those offered through the Forex brokers mentioned in the previous section. &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2016/09/metatrader-4-vs-5-2016-review/63840&quot;&gt;MetaTrader 4 platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is available at every broker mentioned, while the MetaTrader 5 and cTrader platforms are also available at some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Training in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several institutions in Nigeria which claim to be able to train aspiring Forex traders for trading success and profit, in return for a fee covering the provision of this apparent education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although a few of these institutions may be sincere in their intentions, and the attempts of aspiring traders to invest in a proper trading education laudable, the fact remains that paying for Forex training in Nigeria is not be recommended. Simply put, you can find everything you need to know to become a successful and profitable Forex trader for free on the internet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspiring Nigerian Forex traders will see a better return from time spent reading through this site and searching through google for good material than they will see from investing in Nigerian Forex educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you do find material on Forex trading strategies, ask yourself whether any supporting historical data is shown to support the claims made. If not, ask yourself why not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Best Time to Trade Forex in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One advantage that can be enjoyed for free by everyone trading Forex in Nigeria is the time zone. Nigeria is one hour ahead of London, the global center of Forex markets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time to trade Forex is the time during which there is the most volume and liquidity in the market. Studies have shown that the highest volume and liquidity in the Forex market occurs during the overlap between the London and New York sessions, with both remaining relatively high until New York closes for business at the end of its day. Happily, &lt;strong&gt;this means that the best time to trade Forex is between 2pm and 10pm Nigerian time. This is convenient for most Nigerian Forex traders, as it means it will be easy for most to be awake during this period, and most of this time is after normal working hours&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that Nigerians do not have to give up their normal day jobs in order to day trade Forex successfully during peak market hours.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The best thing about forex trading is that it’s educative, exciting, accessible and has many opportunities. Despite the challenges, most traders lack the skills of forex trading, and a high percentage of them lose their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, learning how to trade is difficult, but in this article, you can grab the basics of trading live markets. As a beginner, you can also learn the best trading practices that will make you a successful forex trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to trade, first understand your goals and success you’re aiming as a forex trader. So, what is your objective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide on your objectives, let them be realistic. So, ensure you have set quantifiable and realistic goals. For example, aiming at achieving 20 percent annual returns after the investment or make 5000 USD of profit. So, depending on what you decide, ensure your goals are easy to measure. You need to set your goal, but it should be one that can be easily achieved within a long time frame. It, therefore, becomes crucial to set your goals annual instead of monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps to succeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a trader is obsessed with chasing profits, there are numerous problems that arise. Due to anxiety, it makes people lead to more mistakes and losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need is to avoid setting unrealistic objectives and goals. Operation is risky but giving yourself overconfidence can make you lose even your initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define trading risk profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making a substantial commitment, you have to understand the market fundamental aspect. So, you’ll check at capital you have at hand, get testimonials to avoid setting unrealistic goals and do research on the currency pairs you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find forex trading isn’t comfortable for you with the dynamics, avoid making your investments. It won’t matter whether it’s profitable or not, but it’s a rule for all markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re feeling worried because of the financial reputation or security of a forex broker, it becomes hard to focus on your trading. However, having confidence helps to free up the mental space that makes you devote more attention and time to analyzing and developing your trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect broker (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trusted-broker-reviews.com/order-flow-trading/&quot;&gt;https://www.trusted-broker-reviews.com/order-flow-trading/&lt;/a&gt;) promises to make you successful. So, having any questions, he can comfortably answer them such as insurance, regulations and their trading platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making a decision to trade, come up with a strategy. However, there isn’t a right or wrong method of trading, but the way you will define and use strategy in different ways matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the way you see, sometimes you can find that strategy is working correctly for trading the same pair but in different markets or under certain market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a dream for every trader to be successful. However, in reality, it doesn’t mean that success will be determined by winning all the trades but it is about the average of all your trades after ending with a positive value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to close all your trades with profit but for professionals, they become consistently profitable every day but you aren’t likely to see a trading system lacking a single loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the forex market constantly changes, and therefore necessary for traders to know the pro and cons of the market. Don’t expect for a patterned formula or rules guarantee success in FX trading. It will be a combination of numerous things that needs you to be talented, patient and mindful.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FOREX-Yuan and commodity-linked currencies dive as Chinese virus fears grow - Reuters</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex/forex-yuan-and-commodity-linked-currencies-dive-as-chinese-virus-fears-grow-idUSL8N29W1I4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex/forex-yuan-and-commodity-linked-currencies-dive-as-chinese-virus-fears-grow-idUSL8N29W1I4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;* Investors seek safety as cases of coronavirus rise &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Yuan hits three-week low, Aussie lowest since early December &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Yen bounces but erases most of its early gains &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh&quot;&gt;tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China’s yuan tumbled more than half a percent to a 2020 low, while commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar also fell sharply as escalating fears about the spread of a coronavirus from China sent investors into safer assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yen, frequently viewed as a safe haven, was the main beneficiary, although the move was contained. The Japanese currency briefly rose to its highest since Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic of the virus, which has killed more than 80 people in China. Nearly 2,800 people have been infected globally. China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday that the ability of the coronavirus to spread was getting stronger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s cabinet announced it would extend the Lunar New Year holidays to Feb. 2 to strengthen the prevention and control of the new coronavirus, state broadcaster CCTV reported early on Monday. The holidays had been due to end on Jan. 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has also banned the entry of visitors from China’s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak was first reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While some analysts argue the fear will be worse than reality with the coronavirus (pointing to the low mortality rate), no one is anticipating a Spanish flu repeat – the bigger worry is the economic impact of containment and quarantine strategies, particularly in China,” RBC Capital Markets’ global head of FX strategy Elsa Lignos said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offshore Chinese yuan shed 0.6% to 6.9783 yuan per dollar, its weakest since Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar, which is heavily exposed to the performance of China’s economy, dropped 0.5% to $0.6787 , its lowest since Dec. 2. The New Zealand dollar also lost 0.5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders said market moves could be exaggerated due to low liquidity, because financial markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia are closed for holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yen rose to as high as 108.73 yen but by 0830 GMT it had retraced much of its rise and was last up just 0.1% at 109.12 yen per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo said the “risk-off mood is likely to continue for a while.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moves in other currencies were contained as nervous investors focused almost solely on the virus and China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro nudged up slightly to $1.1032 ahead of the latest reading of a German business sentiment indicator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar index was flat on the day at 97.857. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling held at $1.3075. Positioning data last week showed investors slimming their net long position in the pound ahead of a knife-edge Bank of England decision on Thursday about whether to cut UK interest rates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although some Forex brokers will let you start trading with as little as $1, you will need to deposit at least $12 with a broker offering nano lots or $120 with a broker offering micro lots in order to day trade safely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The amount of money you need to start will depend upon your broker’s:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and your:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;How much money can you make trading Forex&quot; class=&quot;LazyLoading img-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/images/placeholder.svg&quot; data-src=&quot;/files/woman-3261425_1920.jpg&quot; title=&quot;How much money can you make trading Forex&quot;/&gt;In order to trade Forex effectively, you need a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-brokers-reviews/page-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forex broker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Trying to trade Forex using a regular bank account or a money changer is too costly and slow to be a realistic option. So, the starting point to answering this question is, what is the minimum deposit required by a Forex broker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex brokers won’t let you trade with real money until you have deposited their required minimum deposit, which these days is usually about $100. However, &lt;strong&gt;there are Forex brokers that require no minimum deposit at all, so theoretically you could start trading Forex with as little as $1. Unfortunately, if you try to trade Forex with such a small amount of money, you will quickly run into several problems&lt;/strong&gt;, starting with minimum position sizes and maximum leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Broker Minimum Position Size and Maximum Leverage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of Forex brokers will not let you make a trade sized smaller than 1 micro lot (0.01 lots) which is worth 1,000 units of the base currency.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, 1 micro lot of the USD/JPY currency pair is worth $1,000. This means that you will need &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2009/02/the-foundations-of-forex-how-leverage-margin-and-pip-values-are-calculated/440&quot;&gt;leverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in order to make any trade in the USD/JPY currency pair with a deposit of less than $1,000. If a broker offers a maximum leverage of 30 to 1 on this currency pair (typical in the European Union), you will need to deposit at least $33.34 just to make one trade in USD/JPY. If maximum leverage of 50 to 1 is offered (typical in the United States), you will need to deposit at least $20 to make a trade in USD/JPY. If maximum leverage of 500 to 1 is offered (typical in Australia), you will need to deposit at least $2 to make a trade in USD/JPY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just because lots of leverage is offered to you as a trader, does not mean that it is wise to use it. The minimum amount of money you need to make just one trade in Forex is determined by:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The maximum leverage offered by your Forex broker in what you want to trade (leverage varies from asset to asset and country to country); and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The minimum position size you can trade with your broker in what you want to trade (this is usually 1 micro lot).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a few Forex brokers allowing trading in a minimum position size even lower than 1 micro lot. This lower size is 1 nano lot&lt;/strong&gt;, which is equal to 0.001 lots. Continuing with our example of placing a trade in the USD/JPY currency pair, 1 nano lot would be equal to a position size in cash of $100, so with leverage of 100 to 1, a deposit of $1 would be enough margin to open that trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Brokers Offering Nano Lot Trading&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/fxtm/fxtm-review/2193&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FXTM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is a regulated Forex broker offering trading in nano lots. Their highest maximum leverage offered is 1000 to 1 and their minimum deposit required is $10. There are several other brokers also offering trading in nano lots.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/oanda/oanda-review/4&quot;&gt;Oanda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, for example, takes it even further and allows you to place a trade with a position size as low as $1 or 1 unit of any other base currency, meaning you can trade with $1 without using any leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we have considered only broker-imposed limitations affecting how much money you need to start trading Forex. We still need to consider the issues of risk management, stop losses, meaningfulness of profits, and different types of trading styles, all of which are important factors in answering this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Risk Management Affects Deposit Size&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked earlier at the minimum amount of money you need to enter just one trade. Yet &lt;strong&gt;Forex trading involves taking a large number of trades.&lt;/strong&gt; Even a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2010/07/forex-trading-styles-position-trader/5540&quot;&gt;position trader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; who might aim to stay in winning trades for a few weeks or even a few months would probably expect to take at least ten trades over a year, and shorter-term traders such as swing traders or scalpers many more trades than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2016/07/dealing-with-losses/61113&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forex trading involves losing trades&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. There is simply no way around that: any trader, even the very best Forex trader, will lose at least one third of all the trades he makes.&lt;/strong&gt; It is well known that winning and losing trades are not evenly distributed: markets tend to go through winning and losing streaks. This means that &lt;strong&gt;every trader should plan for a worst-case losing streak of at least twenty losing trades in a row.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Every trader should also plan for their worst drawdown&lt;/strong&gt; (peak to trough account decrease). Once your account Is down by more than 20%, it gets harder and harder to get back to the peak, because the gain required to achieve it rises exponentially. For example, if your account is down by 50%, you need to make 100% from what remains to get back to where you were before the 50% loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume you don’t ever want your trading account to be down by more than 20% and your worst losing streak will probably be 20 losing trades in a row. This means that you should risk no more than 1% of your account per trade. But wait – you may only ever lose 20 trades in a row, but it is likely that your net losing trades within any major drawdown will be approximately double that, with a few winners mixed in. This implies that &lt;strong&gt;you probably should risk no more than 0.5% of your account on a single trade.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, if you are going to need due to minimum position sizing, leverage, and trade stop loss requirements, say $1 for a single trade, you will have to multiply that by 200 to come up with the minimum amount you need to trade Forex. You are also going to need to think about how big your typical trade stop loss is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as losing streaks, traders have to worry about a wild, sudden price movement causing massive &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2019/04/what-is-slippage-in-forex-trading/112235&quot;&gt;slippage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; beyond a trade’s stop loss. This usually only happens with pegged or manipulated currencies, such as the Swiss Franc in 2015. This is another reason why it is usually a good idea to risk only a small percentage of your account on any single trade. It should also help to trade liquid major currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Stop Losses Affect Deposit Size&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should never enter a trade without inputting a hard stop loss.&lt;/strong&gt; The hard stop loss tells your broker that when the trade has gone against you by a certain amount, to close the trade immediately. Although the stop loss will not always be executed at the exact price given when markets are volatile, &lt;strong&gt;it is a useful and very important way to limit your risk and control your losses. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop losses should always be determined by technical analysis, not by how big a stop loss you can “afford”&lt;/strong&gt; due to the amount of money in your trading account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say you want to risk 0.5% of your account on a trade, and you want your typical stop loss to be 100 pips. The smallest trade position size your broker allows is 1 micro lot, which on a USD based currency costs $0.10 per pip. This means that your 100 pip stop loss will require that you risk 100 X $0.10 which equals $10. You want this $10 to be no more than 0.5% of your account – and that means you are going to have to make a deposit of $2,000 to start Forex trading with enough money to make 100 pip stop losses work, if your broker only goes as low by size as micro lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t ever make a stop loss smaller than you really want it to be just because you can’t “afford” it with your account size. Either put more money in your account, find a Forex broker that allows trading in nano lots, or consider switching to a style of trading which typically requires tighter stop losses.&lt;/strong&gt; The three styles of Forex trading are position trading, swing trading, and scalping, and we’ll consider them each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much Money Do I Need to Position Trade Forex?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position traders look for trades which take several days or even weeks or months to complete, and so &lt;strong&gt;usually need to use stop losses of about 100 to 150 pips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming you don’t want to risk more than 0.5% of your account on any trade, and that you will never lose more than 20% of your account, you should &lt;strong&gt;start with a deposit of at least $2,500 to $3,750 at a Forex broker offering trading in micro lots, or at least $250 to $375 at a Forex broker offering nano lots. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much Money Do I Need to Swing Trade Forex?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2011/06/swing-trading-advantages-and-disadvantages/8182&quot;&gt;Swing traders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; look for trades which take from between about one to eight days to complete, and so &lt;strong&gt;usually need to use stop losses of about 30 to 60 pips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming you don’t want to risk more than 0.5% of your account on any trade, and that you will never lose more than 20% of your account, you should &lt;strong&gt;start with a deposit of at least $720 to $1,440 at a Forex broker offering trading in micro lots, or at least $72 to $144 at a Forex broker offering nano lots. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much Money Do I Need to Scalp or Day Trade Forex?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalpers or &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2017/01/day-trading-vs-swing-trading/70919&quot;&gt;day traders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; look for trades which take only seconds, minutes, or perhaps a few hours at most to complete, and so &lt;strong&gt;usually need to use stop losses of about 5 to 10 pips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming you don’t want to risk more than 0.5% of your account on any trade, and that you will never lose more than 20% of your account, you should &lt;strong&gt;start with a deposit of at least $120 to $240 at a Forex broker offering trading in micro lots, or at least $12 to $24 at a Forex broker offering nano lots. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Can I Start Forex with $100?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculations discussed above show that it is absolutely possible to trade Forex safely starting with an initial deposit of $100, &lt;strong&gt;if you use a Forex broker offering nano lots or smaller, and you are day trading, scalping or swing trading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is It Worth Trading Forex with a Low Minimum Deposit?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final issue to consider is, even if you can trade Forex safely with a small amount of money such as $50 or $100, is it really worth it? &lt;strong&gt;It all depends how much these sums of money mean to you and how much time and effort you are going to put into trading Forex.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say you double your money in a year. This is a great result for any trader and will probably take a lot of work. Yet if you start with $100, you will only have $200 after this great result. Maybe it isn’t worth it if you can, for example, save that amount of money by making other changes in your life (such as saving more) without putting your capital at risk. &lt;strong&gt;It might be smarter to wait until you have a bigger amount to start with, because then such profit would be more meaningful to you and feel like it is worth the work you put into making it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody should ever trade Forex with money they cannot afford to lose&lt;/strong&gt;, but you probably won’t stay motivated for long if you trade with an amount of money which is so small and trivial to you that you don’t feel like you care much about the result. &lt;strong&gt;You need to find a balance which works for your trading style, your emotional style, and your financial situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The USD/CAD edged up 0.1% to 1.3143. Official data showed that Canada\'s retail sales grew 0.9% on month in November (+0.6% expected). Other commodity-linked currencies were broadly lower against the greenback. AUD/USD slid 0.3% to 0.6829 and NZD/USD slipped 0.1% to 0.6609. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding economic data, the Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) unexpectedly declined to 51.7 (preliminary reading) in January, missing 52.4 expected, while the Services PMI rose to 53.2, better than 53.0 anticipated. Later today, December U.S. new home sales will be reported (up to an annualized rate of 731,000 units expected).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/JPY - 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement Completes &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/JPY  closed at 109.278 after placing a high of 109.650 and a low of 109.170. The USD/JPY pair dropped for the 4th consecutive day on Friday on the back of increased demand for safe-haven Japanese Yen amid rising fears of coronavirus effects on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the data front, the National Core CPI for the year from Japan was released at 4:30 GMT, and it remained flat with the expectations of 0.7%. At 5:30 GMT, the Flash Manufacturing PMI from Japan exceeded the expectations in January and came in as 49.3 against the expected 48.9. Hence, I supported the Japanese Yen on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of the Japanese Yen after the release of Manufacturing PMI put pressure on USD/JPY and dragged its prices further on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan released its December Monetary policy meeting minutes on Friday. In those minutes, the members of the Bank of Japan showed a possible need for further easing if personal spending decreases after the consumption tax increase in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan narrated that there will be a need for further monetary easing if the underlying consumption trend continued in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Governor of Bank of Japan, Haruhiko &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/boj&quot;&gt;Kuroda&lt;/a&gt;, said on Friday that economy likely to suffer in the final quarter of 2019 because of 2 cyclones that struck the country and affected the factory output. He added that natural disasters have intensified in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also added that prolonged lower interest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates&quot;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; could impose adverse effects on the country\'s banking system. On the other hand, he also defended BoJ\'s ultra-easy policy, which helped to eradicate deflation from the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/JPY - Daily Trade Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/JPY is still trading in a selling mode at 108.850, dropping below 50% &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci&quot;&gt;Fibonacci&lt;/a&gt; retracement level, and it\'s heading towards 61.8%, which marks 108.620. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RSI and Stochastics are also heading into the selling zone, signaling chances that the USD/JPY may need to retrace back a bit before heading down further. On the 4 hour timeframe, the USD/JPY pair has opened a with a gap, and typically such gaps are filled with on the same day or a day after that. Let\'s see. But today, we should look for selling trades below 109.150 and buying positions above $108.650.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/CAD - Overbought Pair, Is It Going to Retrace?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/CAD closed at 1.31469 after placing a high of 1.31524 and a low of 1.31175. At 18:30 GMT, the Core Retail Sales for the month of November from Canada was released, which showed a decline of 0.2% against the expectation of 0.5% and weighed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad&quot;&gt;Canadian dollar&lt;/a&gt;. The Retail Sales, however, showed an expansion to 0.9% against 0.6% in the month of November and supported the Canadian dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Core Retail Sales was closely watched among traders to place their bets for Loonie, and when it was released weaker than expected, it weighed on the Canadian dollar and ultimately raised the prices of USD/CAD on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Crude oil was on bearish trend on the back of coronavirus fears on Friday and reached to its lowest since early November. Weak crude oil weighed on commodity-linked Loonie and supported the rise on USD/CAD prices at the ending day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the American front, the U.S. dollar was in strength against its rival currencies on Friday amid the sharp rise in U.S. Services PMI. At 19:45, the Flash Services PMI from the U.S. for the month of January exceeded the expectations of 52.9 and came in as 53.2. Expansion in the Services sector of the United States gave strength to the U.S. dollar and added in the upward movement of USD/CAD pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;USD/CAD - Daily Trade Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USD/CAD is testing the double top level at 1.3196 as the stronger dollar drove the pair higher. On the 240 mins chart, the pair has formed a bullish engulfing candle followed by a series of green candles is also suggesting odds of more buying in the USD/CAD currency pair. Bullish crossover of 1.3196 can lead the USD/CAD prices higher towards 1.3270, while the support continues to stay around 1.3110. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;AUD/USD – Triangle Pattern Breakout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUD/USD pair closed at 0.68251 after placing a high of 0.68569 and a low of 0.68172. The AUD/USD sank to its lowest level since December 11 on Friday amid the sensitive outlook of China\'s economy due to coronavirus fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook of the Chinese economy suffered due to widespread of latest coronavirus in China. The origin of the virus was blamed at Wuhan city of China, which has been blocked by Chinese officials to embrace the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese Equity Market has fallen and suffered a lot because of this virus, and it has also raised the fears that the global economy could get affected because of viruses too. This has resulted in weakened Chinese Yuan, and as a result, China-proxy Australian dollar got weakened also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weak Australian dollar dragged the prices of the AUD/USD pair on Friday. The downfall in pair\'s prices was added after the release of Manufacturing PMI from Australia. At 3:00 GMT, the Flash &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar&quot;&gt;Manufacturing PMI&lt;/a&gt; came in as 49.1 in the month of January, which was less than the December\'s 49.2. The contraction in the Manufacturing Sector of Australia added to the weakness of Aussie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flash Services PMI from Australia for the month of January also declined to 48.9 from December\'s 49.8 and weighed on the Australian dollar. Both the Manufacturing &amp;amp; Services Sector of Australia showed a contraction in the month of January and dragged the pair AUD/USD further on Friday near its multi week\'s lowest level of 0.68100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the U.S. dollar was strong in the financial market against its rival currencies on the back of strong Services PMI. At 19:45 GMT, the Flash Services PMI form the United States showed an expansion in the services sector of the United States for the month of January when released as 53.2 against 52.9. Strong U.S. dollar added in the downfall of Aussie, and hence AUD/USD was dropped further at the ending day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;fxs_headline_medium&quot;&gt;AUD/USD - Daily Trade Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUD/USD has violated the long-held triangle pattern, which supported the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd&quot;&gt;Aussie&lt;/a&gt; around 0.6825. The AUD/USD is now trading at 0.6760, having formed a bearish marabou candle on the 4-hour chart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pair may find immediate support around 0.6760, and below this level, we may see further sell-off until 0.6715. Since the RSI is heavily oversold, we may also experience a bullish correction in the AUD/USD pair. Let\'s consider taking a sell trade below 0.6800 and buying above 0.67500. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is new licensing regime for forex lipstick on a frog? - Business Day</title>
<link>https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2020-01-22-is-new-licensing-regime-for-forex-lipstick-on-a-frog/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2020-01-22-is-new-licensing-regime-for-forex-lipstick-on-a-frog/</guid>
<description>   &lt;p&gt;So far, the new regime is being met with cautious optimism by the local industry. Jimmy Moyaha, an independent consultant in the financial markets space, is clear that change is much needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;With this new regime it’s a real chance to clean up our industry — the local industry has gone through a difficult time recently, we have seen a lot of forex scams and it is very difficult for legitimate providers to conduct business in an environment where consumers are regularly getting scammed,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having interviewed several local forex brokers, this is a recurring theme — that scams and bad brokers are damaging the industry. The more people read about forex scams, and the more people fall victim to unscrupulous brokers, the more the reputation of the industry suffers. And this is something legitimate brokers want to be put right as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Moyaha points out: “&lt;span&gt;We have a real opportunity here with the ODP licence to sweep out all of the junk that’s in the local industry and create a cleaner market. That’s why the ODP licence has been created, I believe — to clean out the bad apples and start again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other brokers we talked to were less sure that the ODP licence is a good thing for the industry, not because new regulation isn’t needed, but because the new regulation is not built for the SA market and will be unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One FSCA-regulated, award-winning brokerage would only speak to us on condition of anonymity. One of their concerns was that the FSCA had not engaged fully with the local industry before deciding on the new regulatory regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;Frankly, in our industry, the cost of compliance is very low — there is an incentive for business to try to circumvent whatever legislation has been put in place. So, anything apart from full engagement [with the forex broking industry] will end in a situation where the FSCA and the market players will be diametrically opposed, which will not end well for anyone,” the broker said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What are the advantages of this new regime? Because I don’t see much. I wish [the FSCA] had gone further, in terms of the suitability requirements for traders and the integration of trading records between market players.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As it stands, the ODP licensing regime is still in the application phase, so it remains to be seen exactly what final form it will take. The FSCA is certainly planning a more transparent and better-regulated market, but the concern is that the new regime will be a redecoration rather than a complete overhaul, the broker said.&lt;/p&gt;   </description>

<title>Forex Today: Risk aversion fuels dollar’s advance - FXStreet</title>

                    &lt;p&gt;Here is what you need to know on Tuesday, January 28th:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;On Sunday, the Chinese Health Commission reported that the coronavirus transmission ability is getting stronger and that infections could continue to rise. Financial markets reflected the concerns related to the virus outbreak, with safe-haven assets gapping higher. The dollar appreciated against most major rivals but those considered a refugee in turmoil times.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;EUR/USD neared 1.1000 as the German IFO Survey missed the market’s expectations in January, combining with the broad dollar’s strength.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GBP/USD peaked at 1.3105 but eased ahead of critical events in the UK later this week. The BOE will meet on Thursday, and there are chances that Governor Carney may cut rates before leaving his seat. Brexit is scheduled for this Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Japanese yen was the strongest, the AUD the weakest in a risk-averse environment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gold gapped higher and held on to gains, finishing the day around $1,580 a troy ounce.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Crude oil prices were also under pressure, ending the day at 3-month lows amid dollar’s strength, fears of an oversupplied market.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/crypto-today-bitcoin-bulls-break-back-above-critical-8500-barrier-202001271950&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Crypto Today: Bitcoin bulls break back above critical $8500 barrier&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

For example, if you are trading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/gbp-usd&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;GBP/USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; you need to be fully in tune with all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/03/27/bank-of-england.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Bank of England&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/08/16/federal-reserve-bank.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;US Federal Reserve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; policy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;moves and speeches – both drive the market. So aim to be on the same wavelength as the central bank/s, but don’t bet against them - they have big pockets and nearly always win.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;2) Under&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;stand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;macro drivers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;“It\'s vitally important for traders to know that all currencies can have many macro drivers at any given point” – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/authors/David_Cottle&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;David Cottle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;dfx-lazyload gsstx&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; data-image-original-width=&quot;165&quot; data-image-original-height=&quot;165&quot; alt=&quot;David Cottle, DailyFX analyst&quot; data-src=&quot;https://a.c-dn.net/b/42DyCL/how-to-become-a-forex-trader_body_Picture_1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/aud&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Australian Dollar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; is a primary example of a currency driven by a range of macro factors. It is often thought of as a ‘growth’ or ‘risk’ correlated unit – one which is likely to gain when the world feels better about global growth and struggle when the reverse is the case.

Here’s the checklist:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;1) Find the right broker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Choosing the best forex broker will make all the difference when it comes to benefiting from quality of user experience, reliable client support and competitive pricing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;2) Know how trading capital works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;As a forex trader you must understand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/02/12/using-margin-in-forex-trading.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/02/08/what-is-leverage-in-forex-trading.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;leverage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;. Margin allows a trader to open leveraged positions, meaning greater exposure to the market with smaller capital outlay. Newer traders often look at unused margin as buying power and therefore tend to be too aggressive on their position sizing. Leverage maximizes gains and losses making your account equity quite volatile. Regardless of the amount of leverage your broker offers, we suggest using little or no leverage in your trading.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;3) Start with a demo account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Practice with a demo account to familiarize yourself with the markets. From here, you can build and refine a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/06/12/top-forex-trading-strategies.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;trading strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;, get comfortable with your chosen platform and build the confidence you need to trade real money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;4) Take the plunge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Trade small with your real money account at first, and work your way up. Trade with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/10/07/risk-management-techniques.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;risk management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt; protocols in place, using stop losses, and only trade when you have undertaken in-depth analysis, whether trading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2019/03/12/how-to-combine-fundamental-technical-analysis.html&quot; class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;fundamentals or technicals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;, or both. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;5) Never stop building your knowledge – and character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gsstx&quot;&gt;Winning traders never stop learning and building their expertise on key markets.

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
							       &lt;p&gt;* Investors seek safety as cases of coronavirus rise &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#13;
  * Yuan hits three-week low, Aussie lowest since early&amp;#13;
  December&amp;#13;
  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#13;
  * Yen bounces but erases most of its early gains&amp;#13;
  &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China\'s yuan tumbled to a 2020&amp;#13;
  low on Monday and commodity-linked currencies such as the&amp;#13;
  Australian dollar fell, as growing fears about the spread of a&amp;#13;
  coronavirus from China pushed investors into safer assets.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The yen was the main beneficiary, although its move higher&amp;#13;
  was limited. The Japanese currency touched its highest since&amp;#13;
  Jan. 8.&amp;#13;
  Health authorities around the world are working to prevent a&amp;#13;
  pandemic of the virus, which has killed more than 80 people in&amp;#13;
China. &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2,800 people have been infected globally. China\'s&amp;#13;
  National Health Commission said on Sunday the ability of the&amp;#13;
  virus to spread was getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;China\'s government announced it would extend the Lunar New&amp;#13;
  Year holidays to help prevent and control the virus. Hong Kong has also banned the entry of people who have&amp;#13;
visited the province of Hubei in the past 14 days. &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak&amp;#13;
  was first reported in Hubei. RBC Capital Markets\' FX strategist Elsa Lignos said that&amp;#13;
  while some would argue that fears about the virus were overdone,&amp;#13;
  given the low mortality rate, &quot;the bigger worry is the economic&amp;#13;
  impact of containment and quarantine strategies, particularly in&amp;#13;
  China.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The offshore yuan shed more than 0.8% to 6.99 yuan per&amp;#13;
  dollar , its weakest since Dec. 30.&amp;#13;
  After rallying to a five-and-a-half month high earlier in&amp;#13;
  January, the yuan has gone into a tailspin. The dollar has&amp;#13;
  gained more than 2% versus the Chinese currency since last&amp;#13;
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt; The Australian dollar, which is exposed to the Chinese&amp;#13;
  economy, dropped 0.8% to $0.6771 , its lowest since Dec.&amp;#13;
  2. The New Zealand dollar weakened 0.7%.&amp;#13;
  Traders said market moves could be exaggerated by low&amp;#13;
  liquidity. Financial markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and&amp;#13;
  Australia are closed for holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The yen rose as high as 108.73 yen but was last down 0.3% at&amp;#13;
  108.91 yen per dollar .&amp;#13;
  &quot;Risk aversion is contagious, and coronavirus has infected&amp;#13;
  confidence across the board at the start of the week,&quot; said Kit&amp;#13;
  Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale.  &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell to a two-month low against the yen of 119.94&amp;#13;
  yen . 0.4% lower. It also lost ground to the Swiss&amp;#13;
  franc, slipping to a 33-month low of 1.0689 francs per euro .&amp;#13;
  The euro erased its earlier gains against the dollar after&amp;#13;
  the Ifo institute said that German business morale deteriorated&amp;#13;
  unexpectedly in January. The euro was unchanged at $1.1026 . &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar index was flat at 97.849 .&amp;#13;
  Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.3090 . Positioning data&amp;#13;
  last week showed investors reducing their net long position in&amp;#13;
  the pound before a Bank of England decision on Thursday about&amp;#13;
  whether to cut UK interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;  &amp;#13;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forex trading in Nigeria has become easier to get involved in during the past decade, which have also mostly seen strong economic growth and rising disposable incomes for many Nigerians despite post-2014 economic problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nigerian Forex traders can learn here how to get started trading Forex, the correct approach to learning how to trade and deciding upon a profitable trading strategy for use, and which &lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-brokers-reviews/page-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forex brokers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; are most suitable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nigeria’s Financial Situation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is home to over 186 million inhabitants, making it the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous in the world. The population is anticipated to exceed 250 million by 2050, while the country is already home to the third-largest youth population as well as the twentieth largest economy in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good measure of Nigeria’s increasing prosperity is the fact the gross domestic product per capita (per person) increased from $352 in 2001 to $3,222 in 2014 – an increase of approximately 900%! However, the figure has fallen sharply since 2014 to a little less than $2,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Nigeria’s position as a relatively prosperous African country, most Nigerians would agree that getting by is neither easy nor simple. When you combine these challenges with the fact that it is not impossible to get some spare cash together, you can see why Forex trading continues to become more and more popular in Nigeria. Despite this plus the fact that Forex traders in Nigeria are believed to trade positions worth as much as $1.25 million daily on average, very few international Forex / CFD brokerages maintain a presence in Nigeria, so Nigerian Forex traders are in need of more impartial guidance, which can be found in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Forex Trading in Nigeria&quot; class=&quot;LazyLoading img-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/images/placeholder.svg&quot; data-src=&quot;/files/nigeria-en-2020.png&quot; title=&quot;Forex Trading in Nigeria&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to Start Forex Trading in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential requirements to get started are the same as in any other country. Traders need to have a computer or mobile device, a stable internet connection, trading capital (more on how much you will need later), and an account with a trusted Forex broker.&lt;strong&gt; Reliability of internet connections and electricity supplies have become considerably more reliable in recent years, especially in urban areas, which makes Forex trading easier&lt;/strong&gt;. However, these factors mean traders in Nigeria should be careful to never execute a trade without inputting a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2019/02/do-you-really-need-a-stop-loss/110154&quot;&gt;hard stop loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, to prevent catastrophic losses in the event of a lost connection which cannot be re-established quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later sections in this article will discuss the practicalities of getting set up as a Forex trader. At this point, I emphasize that there is no point in trading Forex until you have a profitable trading strategy which you are psychologically ready to execute. You will not succeed in Forex with positive &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/forex-trading-psychology/page-1&quot;&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; alone, but a lack of psychological preparation can ruin the ability to successfully execute even a winning, profitable trading strategy.&lt;strong&gt; The lack of a sound trading strategy reduces Forex trading to gambling, with the odds stacked against the trader, and the eventual loss of the entire trading account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most proven trading strategy which has been proven to succeed over the years is a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2017/02/trend-trading-entries-pullbacks-or-breakouts/72528&quot;&gt;strategy which trades only in the direction of a strong trend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, cuts losing trades short, and lets winners run. However, even with such a good strategy, there will be losing trades and losing periods, which the trader must be psychologically ready to accept as inevitable. By keeping &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2017/09/how-much-should-i-risk-trading-forex/84161&quot;&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; small, a Forex trader can ensure survival through the losing periods and coming up ready to profit when the market turns profitable again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is important not to assume that Forex trading is easy money. It requires mental work and dedication.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Is Forex Trading Legal in Nigeria?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Forex trading is legal in Nigeria if you trade your money for your personal benefit alone. This mirrors retail trading regulations in most countries. Raising capital from third parties for their benefit without a proper license to do so is illegal and, tempting as it may be, can get you into trouble if the third parties become dissatisfied and complain. Forex trading where you are managing other people’ money is extremely challenging psychologically. &lt;strong&gt;For these reasons, please trade only with your own money where losses are not catastrophic to your ability to pay your essential costs of living.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Much do I Need to Start Trading Forex in Nigeria?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some Forex and CFD brokerages which require no minimum deposit and accept Nigerian residents as customers, so in theory at least, you can trade Forex in Nigeria with as little as $1. The problem is that due to issues of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2009/02/the-foundations-of-forex-how-leverage-margin-and-pip-values-are-calculated/440&quot;&gt;leverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and currency exchange with most Forex brokers not accepting deposits directly in Nigerian Naira, it is impractical to trade Forex with much less than $100 or its equivalent. Even $100 can be problematic due to trade size and leverage issues, so it is certainly true that something close to $500 will work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Forex broker with expertise in serving Nigerian resident clients is &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/fxtm/fxtm-review/2193&quot;&gt;FXTM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which, unusually for a major international Forex brokerage, has a physical presence in Nigeria. FXTM requires a minimum deposit from Nigerian residents of only ₦2,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Brokers in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian Forex market went through a boom-and-bust cycle between 2004 and 2010, and a wave of Ponzi schemes swept the country during this period. This atmosphere prevented interest in Forex trading in Nigeria from taking off, but the picture has improved considerably since 2010 as a calmer financial environment and generally increasing prosperity began to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FXTM is the sole international Forex / &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2011/06/what-are-cfds/8132&quot;&gt;CFD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; broker with a physical location in the country&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding to its appeal is the Naira trading account, which makes it very simple for traders to manage their portfolios as no currency conversion are required in order to execute deposits and withdrawals to and from an FXTM trading account. &lt;strong&gt;The acceptance of bank wires from Nigerian banks is a further improvement to the services offered by FXTM to Nigerian resident traders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few local Nigerian Forex brokers currently operating, if I were a Nigerian resident Forex trader, I would strongly prefer to open an account with an international brokerage instead of a local solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other international Forex / CFD brokerages which service Nigerian residents include &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/avatrade/avatrade-review/804&quot;&gt;AvaTrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/pepperstone/pepperstone-review/656&quot;&gt;Pepperstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/ic-markets/ic-markets-review/2144&quot;&gt;IC Markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Unfortunately, none of these brokers offer Naira accounts. &lt;strong&gt;Nigerian Forex traders will have to ensure that the brokers provide a payment processor catering to Nigeria, as currency conversions may pose a challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, the Forex market in Nigeria continues to strengthen and become a more attractive venue for international business, with the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbn.gov.ng/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Central Bank of Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (CBA) and the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sec.gov.ng/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (SEC) developing a stronger regulatory framework in recent years. &lt;strong&gt;More international Forex brokers are anticipated to follow FXTM into Nigeria, widening the choice for Nigerian Forex traders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Best Forex Trading Platforms in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best Forex trading platforms for Nigerian resident traders are those offered through the Forex brokers mentioned in the previous section. &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2016/09/metatrader-4-vs-5-2016-review/63840&quot;&gt;MetaTrader 4 platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is available at every broker mentioned, while the MetaTrader 5 and cTrader platforms are also available at some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forex Training in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several institutions in Nigeria which claim to be able to train aspiring Forex traders for trading success and profit, in return for a fee covering the provision of this apparent education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although a few of these institutions may be sincere in their intentions, and the attempts of aspiring traders to invest in a proper trading education laudable, the fact remains that paying for Forex training in Nigeria is not be recommended. Simply put, you can find everything you need to know to become a successful and profitable Forex trader for free on the internet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspiring Nigerian Forex traders will see a better return from time spent reading through this site and searching through google for good material than they will see from investing in Nigerian Forex educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you do find material on Forex trading strategies, ask yourself whether any supporting historical data is shown to support the claims made. If not, ask yourself why not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Best Time to Trade Forex in Nigeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One advantage that can be enjoyed for free by everyone trading Forex in Nigeria is the time zone. Nigeria is one hour ahead of London, the global center of Forex markets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time to trade Forex is the time during which there is the most volume and liquidity in the market. Studies have shown that the highest volume and liquidity in the Forex market occurs during the overlap between the London and New York sessions, with both remaining relatively high until New York closes for business at the end of its day. Happily, &lt;strong&gt;this means that the best time to trade Forex is between 2pm and 10pm Nigerian time. This is convenient for most Nigerian Forex traders, as it means it will be easy for most to be awake during this period, and most of this time is after normal working hours&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that Nigerians do not have to give up their normal day jobs in order to day trade Forex successfully during peak market hours.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The best thing about forex trading is that it’s educative, exciting, accessible and has many opportunities. Despite the challenges, most traders lack the skills of forex trading, and a high percentage of them lose their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, learning how to trade is difficult, but in this article, you can grab the basics of trading live markets. As a beginner, you can also learn the best trading practices that will make you a successful forex trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to trade, first understand your goals and success you’re aiming as a forex trader. So, what is your objective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide on your objectives, let them be realistic. So, ensure you have set quantifiable and realistic goals. For example, aiming at achieving 20 percent annual returns after the investment or make 5000 USD of profit. So, depending on what you decide, ensure your goals are easy to measure. You need to set your goal, but it should be one that can be easily achieved within a long time frame. It, therefore, becomes crucial to set your goals annual instead of monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps to succeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a trader is obsessed with chasing profits, there are numerous problems that arise. Due to anxiety, it makes people lead to more mistakes and losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need is to avoid setting unrealistic objectives and goals. Operation is risky but giving yourself overconfidence can make you lose even your initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define trading risk profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making a substantial commitment, you have to understand the market fundamental aspect. So, you’ll check at capital you have at hand, get testimonials to avoid setting unrealistic goals and do research on the currency pairs you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find forex trading isn’t comfortable for you with the dynamics, avoid making your investments. It won’t matter whether it’s profitable or not, but it’s a rule for all markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re feeling worried because of the financial reputation or security of a forex broker, it becomes hard to focus on your trading. However, having confidence helps to free up the mental space that makes you devote more attention and time to analyzing and developing your trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect broker (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trusted-broker-reviews.com/order-flow-trading/&quot;&gt;https://www.trusted-broker-reviews.com/order-flow-trading/&lt;/a&gt;) promises to make you successful. So, having any questions, he can comfortably answer them such as insurance, regulations and their trading platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making a decision to trade, come up with a strategy. However, there isn’t a right or wrong method of trading, but the way you will define and use strategy in different ways matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the way you see, sometimes you can find that strategy is working correctly for trading the same pair but in different markets or under certain market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a dream for every trader to be successful. However, in reality, it doesn’t mean that success will be determined by winning all the trades but it is about the average of all your trades after ending with a positive value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to close all your trades with profit but for professionals, they become consistently profitable every day but you aren’t likely to see a trading system lacking a single loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the forex market constantly changes, and therefore necessary for traders to know the pro and cons of the market. Don’t expect for a patterned formula or rules guarantee success in FX trading. It will be a combination of numerous things that needs you to be talented, patient and mindful.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FOREX-Yuan and commodity-linked currencies dive as Chinese virus fears grow - Reuters</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex/forex-yuan-and-commodity-linked-currencies-dive-as-chinese-virus-fears-grow-idUSL8N29W1I4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex/forex-yuan-and-commodity-linked-currencies-dive-as-chinese-virus-fears-grow-idUSL8N29W1I4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;* Investors seek safety as cases of coronavirus rise &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Yuan hits three-week low, Aussie lowest since early December &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Yen bounces but erases most of its early gains &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh&quot;&gt;tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China’s yuan tumbled more than half a percent to a 2020 low, while commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar also fell sharply as escalating fears about the spread of a coronavirus from China sent investors into safer assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yen, frequently viewed as a safe haven, was the main beneficiary, although the move was contained. The Japanese currency briefly rose to its highest since Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic of the virus, which has killed more than 80 people in China. Nearly 2,800 people have been infected globally. China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday that the ability of the coronavirus to spread was getting stronger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s cabinet announced it would extend the Lunar New Year holidays to Feb. 2 to strengthen the prevention and control of the new coronavirus, state broadcaster CCTV reported early on Monday. The holidays had been due to end on Jan. 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has also banned the entry of visitors from China’s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak was first reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While some analysts argue the fear will be worse than reality with the coronavirus (pointing to the low mortality rate), no one is anticipating a Spanish flu repeat – the bigger worry is the economic impact of containment and quarantine strategies, particularly in China,” RBC Capital Markets’ global head of FX strategy Elsa Lignos said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offshore Chinese yuan shed 0.6% to 6.9783 yuan per dollar, its weakest since Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar, which is heavily exposed to the performance of China’s economy, dropped 0.5% to $0.6787 , its lowest since Dec. 2. The New Zealand dollar also lost 0.5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders said market moves could be exaggerated due to low liquidity, because financial markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia are closed for holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yen rose to as high as 108.73 yen but by 0830 GMT it had retraced much of its rise and was last up just 0.1% at 109.12 yen per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo said the “risk-off mood is likely to continue for a while.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moves in other currencies were contained as nervous investors focused almost solely on the virus and China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro nudged up slightly to $1.1032 ahead of the latest reading of a German business sentiment indicator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar index was flat on the day at 97.857. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling held at $1.3075. Positioning data last week showed investors slimming their net long position in the pound ahead of a knife-edge Bank of England decision on Thursday about whether to cut UK interest rates.
