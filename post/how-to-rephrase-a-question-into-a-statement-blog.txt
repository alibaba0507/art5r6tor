<h2><strong>how to rephrase a question into a statement</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a standard English yes-or-no question, the verb precedes the subject, often a helping verb like “is,” “must” or “can.” If the question is not yes-or-no, it begins with a question word, like “who,” “what,” “when” or “where.” To turn a question into a statement, remove the question word and put the sentence into standard subject-verb-object order.</p><h2>Stating Instead of Asking</h2><p>The question, “Are you wearing purple?” shows the inverted order, with the helping verb “are” at the beginning, followed by the subject, “you.” A question-word version might ask, “What color are you wearing?” Here, the object, “color,” is first, and then the helping verb and the subject, “you.” Both questions can be turned into statements by putting the subject first, followed by the verb: “You are wearing purple.” The same principle applies to more complex sentences; look for the basic elements: subject, verb and object. For instance, “On Tuesdays, don’t you usually wear purple?” begins with an adverb phrase, “on Tuesdays,” and takes a negative. But the basic statement is formed the same way: “You usually wear purple on Tuesdays” or, in the negative, “You don’t usually wear purple on Tuesdays.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I've heard that men don't like questions. I'm a woman and would like to have better relationships with the men in my life. Give me some examples of ways to rephrase questions into statements, directives or imperatives.</p><p><br>I've recently been reading some of the work of the life coach Talane Miedaner.</p><p>Watching a webcast of a seminar she gave the other day about "breaking through the glass ceiling", a light went on.</p><p>She claims that "men don't like questions" and suggested that women, especially, would communicate better with men if they asked fewer questions and rephrased their communications. Polling men friends, coworkers and relatives, most men seem to agree.</p><p>I work in a male dominated industry and am looking for any way I can increase my influence and effectiveness. I figure this is worth a try.</p><p>Ordinarily, I ask questions about everything compulsively. I do it so instinctively I don't even know I'm doing it, so it's going to take some practice to stop and reframe my questions into forms that are less challenging and threatening to men.</p><p>An example might be: instead of "How was your day?" rephrase it into "Tell me about your day".&nbsp;<br>Another might be: instead of "How are you going to fix this problem?", say "Explain to me how you are going to fix this problem"</p><p>I am looking for more examples, as this kind of rephrasing is far from natural to me. I'd like to create a "cheat sheet" list of sentence openers and forms that I can carry around with me and use as a reminder until this habit is more ingrained. Please give me your suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When rephrasing a question make sure that the new phrasing makes sense to you, helps you to better understand the question, and maintains the meaning of the original question. (You don’t want the question from the test to get lost in translation!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s look at some examples!</p><ul><li><strong>Original Question</strong>: Which of the following factors did not make etiquette an important part of knightly interactions?<ul><li><strong>Rephrased</strong>: One of the following details didn’t make etiquette important to how knights interacted with each other.</li><li><strong>Rephrased</strong>: Three (or four) of the following details made it so that etiquette was important to how knights interacted with each other.

My thoughts have come from observing teachers, instructional aides, parents, and even SLPs who ask a lot, I mean a lot of questions to these populations. It seems like the individuals&nbsp;are continually being tested, whether the adult has that intention or not.</p><p>I have also recently seen blog posts from <a href="http://www.assistiveware.com/dos-and-donts-aac-questions">David Niemeijer</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B32pZmIpUO9BU3RQNmlfNURIODA/view">Maureen Nevers</a>, <a href="http://praacticalaac.org/praactical/dont-ask-5-reasons-to-de-emphasize-questions-in-your-aac-therapy/">Carole Zangari</a> and others whose posts inspired me to write about my thoughts. The authors discussed the difference between questions that are closed-ended and open-ended. In this case, closed-ended questions refer to questions in which the answer is already known, such as, “What shape is a baseball?” Open-ended questions, on the other hand, are ones in which the answer is unknown, such as, “Why do you like baseball?” It is preferable to ask open-ended questions so the responses can include more (core) words and be a reflection of what the person thinks and feels. So, if you find yourself asking several closed-ended questions, it’s best to determine how you can rephrase your questions as open-ended ones.</p><p>For this post, I would like to focus on Yes/No questions (e.g., “Am I a boy?”), which are closed-ended. More specifically, I want to consider how Yes/No questions can be rephrased as statements for more purposeful language. There are cases in which mis-purposed questions are asked. For example, after a child makes a mess with his toys, a parent may ask, “Do you want to help me clean up?” In this case, “No” is not an acceptable response. So, the parent may as well say a statement such as, “Help me clean up.” The content in the question with 8 words is simplified and reduced to a statement with 4 words and it has the correct intention.</p><p>Yes/No questions are also asked to individuals who have unreliable Yes/No responses. A child may shake his head ‘No’ even though you have his favorite drink, and you ask, “Do you want your drink?” Then, he takes the drink, and proceeds to guzzle it down.</p><p>Instead of asking Yes/No questions that are mis-purposed and directed at individuals with unreliable Yes/No responses, we&nbsp;can model various communicative functions as statements. Here are a few other examples of Yes/No questions I’ve heard, and how they can be rephrased as statements:</p><ul><li>“Can you say bye?” -&gt; “Bye”<ul><li>When it’s time to say goodbye, say, “Bye” (and wave). Over time with modeling, the child will wave and say “bye” independently.</li></ul></li><li>(When a child is reaching for more bubbles) “Do you want more bubbles?” -&gt; “More bubbles”<ul><li>During an activity with bubbles, if a child indicates he wants more, say, “More bubbles” (and sign ‘more’). Here, you’re modeling how the child can request more bubbles.</li></ul></li><li>(A child is smiling and moving in his chair as he eats a cookie) “Is that good?” -&gt; “Mmmmm, good.” or “You like that.”<ul><li>If you see a child enjoying something like a cookie, make a simple comment such as, “Mmmmm, good” (and rub your tummy), or “You like that”. There’s no reason to ask a question when the answer is really obvious; plus, you’re modeling how to comment.</li></ul></li></ul><p>When we rephrase our questions as statements, we go from ‘testing’ to ’teaching’ language. We’re teaching language in the sense that we’re modeling how to use verbal and non-verbal language for different purposes (greetings, farewells, requesting, commenting, etc.). And we’re doing this via various routines that recur frequently. It has been shown that this style of teaching allows young children and individuals with AAC needs to learn language more effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
