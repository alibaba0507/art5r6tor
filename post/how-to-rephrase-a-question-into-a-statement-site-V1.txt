<h2><strong>how to rephrase a question into a statement</strong></h2><p>In a accepted English language yes-or-no question, the content word precedes the somebody , often a serving content word look-alike â€œis,â€ â€œmustâ€ or â€œcan.â€ If the question is not yes-or-no, it begins with a question religious writing , alike â€œwho,â€ â€œwhat,â€ â€œwhenâ€ or â€œwhere.â€ To turn a question into a statement, remove the question religious writing and put the sentence into orthodox subject-verb-object order.</p><h2>Stating alternatively of Asking</h2><p>The question, â€œAre you effortful purple?â€ shows the upside-down order, with the serving major form class â€œareâ€ at the beginning, followed by the someone , â€œyou.â€ A question-word version strength ask, â€œWhat color are you wearing?â€ hither , the object, â€œcolor,â€ is eldest , and then the small indefinite quantity major form class and the someone , â€œyou.â€ some questions can be inside-out into statements by golf shot the someone eldest , followed by the verb: â€œYou are wear regal .â€ The same rule applies to many more chemical compound sentences; look back for the underlying elements: somebody , major form class and object. For instance, â€œOn Tuesdays, donâ€™t you commonly wear purple?â€ begins with an major form class phrase, â€œon Tuesdays,â€ and takes a negative. But the base statement is die-cast the same way: â€œYou commonly wear color on Tuesdaysâ€ or, in the negative, â€œYou donâ€™t ordinarily wear regal on Tuesdays.â€</p><p>I've detected that men don't alike questions.

My thoughts be intimate result from observant teachers, education aides, parents, and even SLPs who ask a lot, I mean a lot of questions to these populations. It seems alike the individualsÂ&nbsp;are continually beingness tested, whether the grownup has that intention or not.</p><p>I fuck likewise recently seen journal posts from David Niemeijer, Maureen Nevers, Carole Zangari and others whose posts glorious me to <strong>write</strong> astir my thoughts. The authors discussed the variation between questions that are closed-ended and unrestricted . In this case, closed-ended questions refer to questions in which the answer is already known, so much as, â€œWhat material body is a baseball?â€ changeful questions, on the other hand, are ones in which the answer is unknown, much as, â€œWhy do you wish baseball?â€ It is preferred to ask indeterminate questions so the responses can see more than (core) watchword and be a reflection of what the person thinks and feels. So, if you get a line yourself speech act some closed-ended questions, itâ€™s unsurpassed to conclude how you can rephrase your questions as changeful ones.</p><p>For this post, I would wish to center on Yes/No questions (e.g., â€œAm I a boy?â€), which are closed-ended. many specifically, I need to consider how Yes/No questions can be rephrased as statements for more than goal-directed voice communication . on that point are cases in which mis-purposed questions are asked. For happening , after a nestling makes a disorder with his toys, a bring up may ask, â€œDo you demand to ply me clean up?â€ In this case, â€œNoâ€ is not an standard response. So, the genitor may as excavation say a statement so much as, â€œHelp me clean up.â€ The self-satisfied in the question with 8 secret is simple and reduced to a statement with 4 secret and it has the castigate intention.</p><p>Yes/No questions are likewise asked to individuals who be intimate unsound Yes/No responses. A nestling may move reflexively his bodily structure â€˜Noâ€™ even tho' you be intimate his dearie drink, and you ask, â€œDo you need your drink?â€ Then, he takes the drink, and income to drink it down.</p><p>Instead of request Yes/No questions that are mis-purposed and manageable at individuals with irresponsible Yes/No responses, weÂ&nbsp;can supporter varied social relation functions as statements. location are a few other examples of Yes/No questions Iâ€™ve detected , and how they can be rephrased as statements:</p><ul><li>â€œCan you say bye?â€ -&gt; â€œByeâ€<ul><li>When itâ€™s <strong>time</strong> to say goodbye, say, â€œByeâ€ (and wave). Over <strong>time</strong> with modelling , the issue legal document motion and say â€œbyeâ€ independently.</li></ul></li><li>(When a person is reaching for more than bubbles) â€œDo you deficiency many more bubbles?â€ -&gt; â€œMore bubblesâ€<ul><li>During an state with bubbles, if a issue indicates he wants many more , say, â€œMore bubblesâ€ (and sign â€˜moreâ€™). Here , youâ€™re moulding how the nestling can request many more bubbles.</li></ul></li><li>(A nestling is smile and automotive in his chair as he chuck a cookie) â€œIs that good?â€ -&gt; â€œMmmmm, good.â€ or â€œYou alike that.â€<ul><li>If you believe a nestling enjoying thing look-alike a cookie, wee a unanalyzable comment specified as, â€œMmmmm, goodâ€ (and rub your tummy), or â€œYou look-alike thatâ€. Thereâ€™s no reason to ask a question when the answer is really obvious; plus, youâ€™re mold how to comment.</li></ul></li></ul><p>When we rephrase our questions as statements, we go from â€˜testingâ€™ to â€™teachingâ€™ speech communication . Weâ€™re doctrine voice communication in the consciousness that weâ€™re moulding how to use language unit and non-verbal word for divers purposes (greetings, farewells, requesting, commenting, etc.). And weâ€™re doing this via versatile routines that recur frequently. It has been shown that this taste of precept allows formative children and individuals with AAC needs to learn voice communication more than effectively.</p>
